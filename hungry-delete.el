;; This file is not part of GNU Emacs.

;;; Commentary:

;; cc-mode implements hungry deletion for its programming modes.  This
;; package borrows its implementation in a minor mode, so that hungry
;; deletion can be used in all modes.

;;; Installation

;; To use this mode, put the following in your init.el:
;; (require 'hungry-delete)

;; You then need to enable hungry-delete-mode, either in
;; relevant hooks, with turn-on-hungry-delete-mode, or with
;; global-hungry-delete-mode.
